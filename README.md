# README for buying Movie resources application

This project is an individual assignment of advanced web application development course at the university of aberdeen.

The application developed by me is a Ruby on Rails application. This website is mainly for viewing the copyright of movies. In order to maintain the copyright of the film, we sell movie resources for users to watch movies. I specially selected the best box office movie of the year 1980-2018 to be the theme of this time. User add the item in the cart and place order without login. Once order placed, they get an email notification. I also use highcharts to display the worldâ€™s yearly top-grossing movie from 1980-2018 and display the Oscar Pictures table from 1927-2014. Users contact us using google map and telephone. Customers sign up and log in for authentication
